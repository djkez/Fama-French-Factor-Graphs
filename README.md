# Fama–French Factor Graphs

Python tool to visualise factor regressions and exposures. Includes a merge utility that combines the Fama–French 2×3 factors with the Momentum file (both from Kenneth French’s Data Library) so you can run six-factor analysis on aligned dates.

Important: when downloading the CSVs for the merged set, do **not** tick ‘In percent’ on French’s website, or the program will misread the inputs.
